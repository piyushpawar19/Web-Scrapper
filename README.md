we are going to scrape the Formula 1 Drivers 2022 from the official Formula 1 website using Node.JS, Node-Fetch and Cheerio. The main reason why I chose Node-Fetch and Cheerio is simply that many people will be familiar with the syntax and both of them are very easy to use and understand.

Cheerio uses core jQuery which makes selecting elements extremely easy and if you have worked with Fetch on the front end of the web, then this would be very familiar to you. Also, I need to mention that Fetch will be bundled in Node.js in the near future so you won’t have to install it as a separate package. That’s always a plus.
